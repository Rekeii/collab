## Chapter 1 - Counting Methods
The word *digit*  was derived from the latin word for "finger," which is really cool since we all were taught first how to count using our fingers.

### Number vs Numeral
- They are not the same thing.

| Number                                                   | Numeral                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is an abstraction, i.e. you can't see nor feela  number. | tangible object or group of objects that represents aa number. |
   
### Cipher = 0
ex. The numeral 1 followed by three ciphers represents a *thousands.* (1000)

### "infinity"
Infinity is entirely different from any whole number or any sort of number. It is usually represented as a *lemniscate* (∞), the small Greek Letter *omega* (ω), or the capital Hebrew letter *aleph* (ℵ) with a numeric subscript that defines its *density.*

### The Counting Base
The *radix* or *base* of a numeration system is the number of single-digit symbols it has. The *radix-ten system*, also called *base-ten* or the *decimal numeration system*, therefore has ten symbols, not counting commas (or decimal points. But there also other systems that uses bases other than ten and that have more or less than ten symbols to represent the digits (ex. Base-two and base-sixteen that are commonly used in computer science).

#### The roman system
The Roman numeration scheme can be considered as a **base-five system**, at least when you start counting in it.

#### The octal system

#### The hexadecimal system
the base-sixteen or hexadecimal numeration system works.

#### The binary system
Typically used in computers and calculators in the 20th century. They wanted a way to count up to large numbers using only two digits, one to represent "on" and one to represent "off."

## Chapter 2 - The Language of Sets
A **set** is a collection or group of things called *elements* or *members.*

### If in:
The "pitchfork" symbol means "is an element of." It is read as, *x is an element of set A*.
$$x\in A$$

### If Out:
It is read as, *x is **not** an element of set A*.
$$x\notin A$$

### Listing Elements
When you list the elements of a set, it is enclosed in "curly brackets" or *braces.* Order or repetition does not matter.
$$\left\{1, 2, 3\right\}$$ $$\left\{3, 2, 1\right\}$$ $$\left\{1, 3, 3, 2, 1\right\}$$ $$\left\{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, \cdots  \right\}$$

### Empty Set
A set can exist even if there are no elements in it. It is called an *empty set* or the *null set.* Can be written as either the two:
$$\left\{ \right\}= \emptyset  $$
They both mean the same thing or rather represent the same thing. An empty or null set. An empty set is also finite since you can name all the elements of the null set: "This set has no elements"

### How Sets Relate
#### Venn Diagram
One of the best diagrams to use to show relationships among sets. 

![[Pasted image 20210926160534.png]]

The "emperor of sets" is called the *universal set* or the *universe.*

#### Subsets
This is when all the elements of a set are also contained within another set. 
$$A \subseteq B$$

The subset represents only a part and not the whole set. The smaller set is called a *proper subset* of the larger one. 

#### Congruent sets
Congruent meaning being in congrous, being in agreement or harmony. (Merriam-webster, [Source](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/congruous))

$$E = \left\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \cdots \right\}$$
$$F = \left\{7/7, 14/7, 21/7, 28/7, 35/7, \cdots \right\}$$

At first glance they seem different but when you look closely, they're really the same set. 
$$7/7 = 1$$
$$14/7 = 2$$
$$21/7 = 3$$
$$28/7 = 4$$
$$35/7 = 5$$
$$\downarrow $$
$$\text{and so on...}$$

Every element in set *E* has exactly one "mate" in set *F* and vice versa. The elements in both sets exist in a *one-to-one correspondence.*
When two sets have elements that are identical, and all the elements in one set can be paired off one-to-one with all the elements in the other, they are said to be *congruent sets.* (Pr *equal sets* or *coincident sets*). Therefore,
$$E = F$$
This indicates that two sets are congruent. 
$$E \equiv  F$$

#### Disjoint Sets
When two sets are completely different, no common elements whatsoever, these are called *disjoint sets.* Disjoint sets can be either infinite or finite.

$$G = \left\{1, 2, 3, 4 \right\}$$
$$H = \left\{5, 6, 7, 8, \cdots \right\}$$

#### Overlapping Sets
When two sets have at least one element in common, these are called *overlapping sets.* Or in other texts, *nondisjoint sets.* Congruent sets overlap in the strongest sense since they have all the elements in common while two overlapping sets share some but not all of their elements.

$$L = \left\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \right\}$$
$$M = \left\{6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \right\}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$P = \left\{21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33 \right\}$$
$$Q = \left\{25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37\right\}$$
$$\text{or}$$
$$R = \left\{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 \right\}$$
$$S = \left\{12, 13, 14 \right\}$$

*S* is a subset of *R.* In fact, *S* is a proper subset of *R.*
