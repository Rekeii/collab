**Literature**, in its broadest sense, is any written work. Etymologically, the term derives from Latin *litaritura/litteratura* ‚Äú*writing formed with letters*,‚Äù although some definitions include spoken or sung texts. More restrictively, it is writing that possesses literary merit. Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose. It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama, and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre).

## THE PERIODS OF PHILIPPINE LITERATURE

### SPANISH LITERATURE

	<b>Mayon</b>
<br />
Kristian Sendon Cordero
<br />
	<em>Camarines Sur</em>
<br />
<br />
Ayon sa alamat, lason ng pan ani Pantuga,
<br />
ang lumikha sa bulkan-libingan ito
<br />
ng dalagang namatay sa isang digmaan.
<br />
<br />
Ngayon, ano ang tutubo sa paanan ng Mayon
<br />
gayong nagiging malawak na itong sementeryo
<br />
ng abo, ng tao. Manganganak na kaya ito?
<br />
Tinitigan ko ang nakangangang bulkan-binabalot
<br />
ng ulap at ng sariling usok ang tuktok, gatas sa labi.
<br />
Baka sakali, magpakita, nang may silbi ang kamera.
<br />
<br />
Sa ilang retrato na ibinebenta ng mga bata sa Cagsawa
<br />
lusaw na putik ang nagliliyab na lava, dumadaloy pababa.
<br />
Matandang nag-nganga ayon naman sa isang makata.
<br />
<br />
Sa isang lumang postcard na Nakita ko sa Antigo Merkado-
<br />
Kapag sa malayo, isa siyang magandang sikyung nakatanod,
<br />
Handa sa pagkapkap, naghihintay sa iyong pagpasok.
<br />
