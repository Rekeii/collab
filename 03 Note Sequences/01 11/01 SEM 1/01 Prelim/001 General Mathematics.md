## WEEK 1
- represents real-life situations using functions, including piece-wise functions.
- performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition of functions.
- solves problems involving functions.

### Relation
- a rule that relates values from a set of values (called domain) to a second set of values (called the range)
- elements of the domain can be imagined as input to a machine that applies a rule to these inputs to generate **one or more outputs**.
- A relation is also a set of ordered pairs (x,y)

### Function
- *a relation* where each element in the domain is related to only one value in the range by some rule
- elements of the domain can be imagined as input to a machine that applies a rule so that each input corresponds to **only one output**.
- A function is a set of ordered pairs (x,y) such that not two ordered pairs have the same x-value but different y-values.

#### Domain
- **independent** elements of the set of the values of “x”

#### Range
- **dependent** elements of the set of the values of “y”.

### Functions can be represented in different ways.
#### As a machine

### Activity 2 : Function or Not?

| Answer   |       x        |           y            |
| -------- |:--------------:|:----------------------:|
| Function |   Automobile   |      Plate Number      |
| Not      |  Math Teacher  |   Student in a Class   |

| Not      |   Shoe Size    |  Students in a Class   |
| Function | Locker Number  |        Student         |
| Not      |      Cost      |        Product         |
| Function | Family Member  | Social Security Number |
| Not      | Street Address |     Family Member      |
| Not      |     Height     |   Student in a Class   |
	

### Piecewise Function
A **piecewise function** is a function where more than one formula is used to define the output. Each formula has its own domain, and the domain of the function is the union of all of these smaller domains. We notate this idea like this:

$$
\begin{equation*}
f(x)=\begin{cases}
          \text{formula 1} \quad &\text{if} \, x \text{ is in domain 1} \\
          \text{formula 2} \quad &\text{if} \, x \text{ is in domain 2} \\
		  \text{formula 3} \quad &\text{if} \, x \text{ is in domain 3}
     \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
$$

#### Examples
$$

\begin{equation*}
f(x)=\begin{cases}
          7x + 3 \quad &\text{if} \, x < 0 \\
          7x + 6 \quad &\text{if} \, x \geq 0 \\
     \end{cases}
	 \ , evaluate
\end{equation*}
$$

#### Solution:
