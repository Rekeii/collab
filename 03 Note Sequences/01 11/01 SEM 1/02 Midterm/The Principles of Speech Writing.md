## Audience Profile
- pertains to the important details about your audience,
- *audience analysis* - entails looking into the profile of your target audience. To tailor-fit your speech content and delivery to your audience.
	- *Demography* - age range, male-female ratio, educational background, affiliations or degree program taken, nationality, economic status, academic or corporate designations.
	- *Situation* - time, venue, occasion, size/population
	- *Psychology* - values, beliefs, attitudes, preferences, cultural and racial ideologies, and needs.

It is important to consider your audience. When speaking to a larger audience you might be much more inclined to use formal language rather than causal and intimate language when performing to a smaller audience. When you take into account your audience, the speech becomes much more relevant, understandable, relatable and even enjoyable. If your audience are fourth-graders, using deep technical terms would not help in their enjoyment of your speech in the slightest.

Knowing your audience helps you in terms of topic, word choice, examples, language and duration.

## Choosing a Topic
- start with what you know or are interested to know. Then, ask yourself:
	- Is the topic interesting to my audience?
	- Is it timely and relevant?
	- Are there available sources of information on it?
- If yes, then you might have a good topic in mind. Answers to questions' 1 and 2 depends on your audience profile ^[[The Principles of Speech Writing#Audience Profile]].

## Sourcing Information
- think of the possible sources you can consult.
	- video documentaries, textbooks, other print sources such as magazines, journals, newspapers; surveys/questionnaires; microfilms; and other similar materials.
- take note of each source and cite all of your sources.
- remember: plagiarism is bad and will compromise your credibility.

## Outlining and Organizing the Content
- an effective practice is "Ride to Three"
	- keep the focus of the speech by limiting the ideas to expound to three (3).


## Logical Organization
- **Categorical/Topical** - most *common* pattern. Goal: create categories of information that support the main idea.
- **Comparison/Contrast** - used to compare and contrast subjects or ideas.
- **Spatial** - organizes information according to how things fit together in physical space. Appropriate when main points are oriented to various locations that can exist independently. Show that your main points have clear locations.
- **Chronological** - pattern based on time order they appear. In the order which they happened.
- **Biographical** - used to describe a person's life, speaker's (autobiographical), someone else's, famous person. Mainly informative or entertaining.
- **Casual** - show cause-and-effect relationships. 
- **Problem-Cause-Solution** - describes problem, identifies, recommends solution.
- **Psychological** - *a* leads to *b* and *b* leads to *c*. Typically in persuasive speeches to follow a *logical argument.*

## Duration
- should be just long enough to fulfill speech goals and short enough to hold your audience's attention.
## Word Choice
- your choice of words will depend on your audience. 
- formality of the language is here too and dependent on your audience.

## Gramatical Correctness
- edit and revise your speech of the following:
	- grammar, punctuation, unity, coherence, and others.
- mistakes can be jarring to hear as an audience and may keep the audience from understanding the main point of the message you're trying to convey.
- you may lose credibility.
