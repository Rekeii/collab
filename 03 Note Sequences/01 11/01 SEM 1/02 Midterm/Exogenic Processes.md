# [[Exogenic Processes]]
Upon completion of this lesson, the learners are expected to:
- describe how rocks undergo weathering **(S11/12ES-IIa-22)**;
- explain how the products of weathering are carried away by erosion and deposited elsewhere**(S11/12ES-IIa-b-23)**; and
- explain how rocks and soil move downslope due to direct action of gravity**(S11/12ES-IIb-22)**.

## Exogenous Processes on Earth

The exogenous processes are natural processes that occur on or near the surface of Earth. They leave significant changes on the landscape and/or the ecosystem of the area. This can be either harmful and helpful.

### Types of Exogenous Processes
#### **Weathering**
- Disintegration of rocks, soils and minerals together with other materials through contact with Earth's subsystems.
- Can happen without mivoement or transportation (erosion needs movement)
- Happens on the spot.

##### **Physical Weathering** 
- breakdown of rocks by mechanical forces concentrated along rock fractures. ^40b47b
- may be due to, sudden or not, temperature, pressure, frost, etc. (ex. soils crack because of extreme heat or drought)
- water, wind or ice may scrape rocks or soils.

##### **Chemical Weathering**
- breakdown of rocks by chemical reactions.
- new or secondary minerals develop and sometimes replace the original properties of the minerals in the original rock or soil.
- **Oxidation** and **hydrolysis** are chemical processes that contribute to these changes. (Ex. the presence of water and oxygen in the biological decomposition of microbial action in rocks may cause them disintegrate, acid rain causes earth materials to weaken and change chemical properties.)
- Sinkholes, caverns and karsts are also caused by chemical weathering.
- **Carbonation** from limeston-ebased ground may cause it to thin out and loosen up, making the ground fragile.

#### **Erosion**
- process by which the Earth's surface is worn away by wind, water, or ice.
- *moves* rock debris or soil from one place to another.
- usually when there is rainfall, surface runoff, flowing river, seawater intrusion, flooding, freezing and thawing, hurricane, wind, etc. ^042156
- these processes are capable of exfoliating and scraping the surface and exposing the layers underneath it.
- living organisms can cause erosion too. When animals stampeded or migrate, their movement can cause erosion. When animals overgraze. Deforestation and urbanization.
- causes massive *deterioration* and *destruction* of surface structure and foundation.

#### **Mass Wasting**
- movement of materials on a *downslope* terrain due to gravity.
- usually happens in slopes.
- dangerous because of the increasing weight of the materials picked up as the downward movement progresses that can cause mud and debris avalanches.
- causes loss of life and injury, property damage, loss of capital assets or interruption to economic activities.
- can be classified into different forms of mass wasting, according to their speed of movement, type of materials, and manner by which the materials move: debris flow, mud flow and slump.

##### **Debris Flow**
- when a large amount of sediments fall downslope. Does not need water.

##### **Mud Flow**
- combined soil and water flow downslope. Happens near rivers or streams or wherever land is always moist or has been soaked in water for a long time.
- Its weight indicates the severity of the risk.

##### **Slump**
- slow downslope movement of loosely consoidated materials or rock and soil layers.
- In time, the area becomes curved because of the depression formed by the downslope movement of the land.

#### Sedimentation 
- accumulation of materials such as soil, rock fragments, and soil particles settling at the bottom. Over time, the sediment load becomes thick and forms a new layer of ground.
- usually occurs in stream and sea erosion.
- in small inland waters, this sediment layer eventually dries up and becomes a part of the soil in its environment.
- in oceans, forms ocean basin. They can change shape and size due to continuous geologic cycle. (change depends on the rate of erosion).
