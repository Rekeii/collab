# [[Endogenic Processes]]
Upon completion of this lesson, the learners are expected to
- explain why the Earth’s interior is hot **(S11/12ES-IIb-c-23);**
- describe how magma is formed **(S11/12ES-IIc-24)**
- describe what happens after magma is formed **(S11/12ES-IIc-25)**; and
- describe the changes in mineral components and texture of rocks due to changes in pressure and temperature **(S11/12ES-IIc-d-26)**.

## Endogenous processes 
Endogenous processes are caused by forces from *within or in the interior of Earth*. The driving force is the thermal energy of the mantle and the crust. Most of the thermal energy originates from the decay and disintegration of radioactive elements in Earth's core.

They are also responsible for earthquakes, movement of plates leading to development of continents, mountain building, volcanic activities and other movements related to Earth's crust. Some endogenous processes that played a role in the evolution of landforms on Earth are:

### Types of Endogenous Processes

#### **Magmatism**
- occurs when magma is generated and develops into igneous (magmatic) rocks.
- magma is very hot and is constantly moved by internal heat.
	- forms when rocks reach temperatures between 800°C and 1200°C. 
- process can take place either under the surface or on Earth to become part of the crust.
- additional mass and volume to the surface of Earth forms mountains and volcanoes.

#### **Volcanism or Plutonism**
- process that happens after magma is formed. 
- magma tries to escape from the source through openings like volcanoes or existing cracks on the ground. 
	- comes out with extreme heat and pressure; causes destructive explosions.
- when magma is outside and on the surface of the Earth, it is not called **lava.**

#### **Metamorphism**
- process of changing the materials that make up a rock.
- chemical and geologic characteristics of the rock change due to heat, fluids and pressure that is increasing or decreasing.
- minerals in the rock may change even if it does not melt.
	- Types of metamorphism:
		- **Contact metamorphism **
			- If rock minerals and texture change because of heat.
		- **Regional metamorphism**
			- If the change in a rock happens in a larger or more extensive area, ex. mountain range. Resulting in a larger-scale action of heat and pressure.
- rocks changing due to weathering and sedimentation are not considered to have undergone metamorphism.

### Types of Stress Influencing Rock Behavior

#### **Compression**
- rocks push or squeeze against one another where the stress produced is directed toward the center.
- when rocks meet, the orientation could either be horizontal or vertical.
	- Horizontally, the crust may thicken or shorten.
	- Vertically, the crust can thin out or break off.

#### **Tension**
- rocks are pulled apart and may separate in opposite directions.
- rocks may move farther away from one another.
- speculated that this type of stress is what separated all the continents in the world during the breaking away of the supercontinent known as Pangaea.
