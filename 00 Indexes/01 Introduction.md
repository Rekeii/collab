# Introduction
An introduction to this spaghetti-style, absolutely scuffed hub of our brains combined. All done via [git](https://git-scm.com) and [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md/)

## File system explained:

- **00 Indexes** - filled with indexes that goes to note to note. 
- **01 Checklists**  - checklists.
- **02 Final Notes** - final or permanent notes (may or may not utilize), is not necessary. We can go full non-hierarchal note-taking.
- **03 Note Sequences** - halfway there to being permanent notes, may also be a sort of hub that leads to many quick notes.
- **04 Literary Notes** -  encoded reading materials.
- **05 Quick Notes** - dump for our notes. No hierarchy, completely fine if it's messy.
- **06 Reading Materials** - dump for reading materials such as pdfs, etc.
- **07 Media** - media dump folder.
- **08 Templates** - templates. (Enable Settings > Core Plugins > Templates , change template folder to 08 Templates)
