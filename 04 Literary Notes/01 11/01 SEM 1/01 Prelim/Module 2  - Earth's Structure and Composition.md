## Uniqueness of Earth
What makes Earth different form other planets in the solar system? There is life on Earth. Several factors necessary to support and sustain life are found on Earth. One of the factors that can sustain life is water which in its liquid form is vital for DNA and proteins to swim around and interact with the environment to carry out reactions needed for life. Other planets, because of their distance from the sun, have temperatures that do not allow water to be in liquid form. Hence, water that remains in solid form (ice) may not be able to dissolve many substances needed for chemical reactions that make life possible. In fact, astronomers often focus on habitable zones of stars, also called the *Goldilocks zone* (orbits of planets that are neither too hot nor too cold for life to exist), to search for extraterrestrial life. In the case of Earth, its position is right exactly on the habitable zone of the sun. The present locations of Mars (too cold) and Venus (too hot) lie outside of this zone.

### Big Idea
Earth lies within the "habitable zone" of the solar system which is why life evolved on Earth. Therefore, humans should protect and preserve other natural factors (like water) that promote and enhance life on Earth.

Earth is what it is now because of all the processes that occur outside and within its realm. You will now explore these events and processes to learn about Earth's nature and dynamism.

## The Systems of Earth
When changes in Earth's systems (which refers to Earth's interacting physical, chemical and biological processes) have finally settled, it was presumed that it evolved into four subsystems (geosphere, hydrospehere, atmosphere, and biosphere) that interact to carry out many different natural processes. The interaction of matter and energy was restricted within and, hence, Earth would have its own unique system involving the interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes all made possible because of the composition and nature of its subsystems. This concept was actually proposed by the Gaia hypothesis which states that organisms interact with their inorganic surroundings and establish a self-regulating, complex system that helps maintain the conditions necessary for life on the planet.

### The Geosphere
The **geosphere** is the solid portion of Earth that includes the interior structure, rocks and minerals, landforms, down to the deep depths of the core, and the processes that shape Earth's surface. All the continents and the ocean floor are also considered part of the geosphere. Essentially, this is the solid ground on Earth. Scientists that study this part of Earth are called geologists. It should be clear that the term "geosphere" covers all the solid part of Earth both on its surface up to the deeper depth of the core, as opposed to "lithosphere" which covers only the crustal part and upper mantle of Earth.

#### Geosphere's Internal Structure and Surface Features
Recall that Earth has three main layers: the crust, mantle, and core. The different layers change in density, mineral composition, and thickness with depth. Modern technology has allowed the identification of materials in the interior of Earth through seismic waves. As a basic concept, there are two types of waves traveling through Earth: the *p-waves,* which travel fast through both solids and liquids, and the *s-waves,* which slowly travel only through solids. Seismologists and volcanologists study the components of Earth through seismic waves. The succeeding discussions on the layers of Earth show new findings obtained from the study of seismic waves (see Figure 2.2 on the next page).

1. *Crust.* The crust consists of a 5- to 70-km thick layer of oceanic and continental crust overlaying another thick layer of rocks and metals. The continental crust is thicker than the oceanic curst. Most of the crust is composed of elements that include oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. These are the same elements we know now as inorganic materials that we process to produce things we commonly use today, such as glass (SiO₂), concrete (CaCO₃), and steel.

![[Pasted image 20210809023834.png]]

Fig 2.2 The existence of a structural boundary (Moho) is evidenced by the difference in seismic waves measured in the crust and the mantle. Seismic waves travel faster in the mantle because it has denser materials.

Just above the upper mantle, and still part of the crust, is the *Mohorovičić discontinuity*. This boundary was discovered by Croatian seismologist Andrija Mohorovičić (1857-1936) in 1909 while studying the seismic waves in an earthquake in Croatia. The velocity of the seismic waves behaved differently as they traveled through the layer before the mantle (which is why it was termed as "discontinuity"). The Mohorovičić discontinuity or Moho is now recognized as the transitional boundary that divides the crust from the mantle (see Figure 2.2).

2. *Mantle.* The mantle is made of solid rock, is the largest part of Earth, and makes up 84% of Earth's total volume. It lies between the extremely hot core and the thin outer layer, the crust. At the upper part of the mantle directly below the crust is the asthenosphere. The extreme temperature and pressure in the astenosphere causes the rocks to become ductile and thus move like liquid. The astenosphere radiates heat from the mantle toward the surface. The flow of molten rocks forces some brittle parts of the crust to break, causing faults to form. Some rigid parts of the crust, on the other hand, just "float" or move about slowly on this liquid-like layer, supporting the movement of plates as described in the plate tectonics theory.

#### Reflect Upon
If the crust were the thickest layer of Earth, what effect would its thickness have on organisms? Will the continents still move?

The rocks that make up the mantle are made mostly of silicate minerals. Common silicates found in the mantle include pyroxene, olivine, and garnet. The limited knowledge that scientists have on the mantle is derived from the xenoliths, or rocks embedded in another rock. When magma flows from Earth's surface, it cools and various rocks are formed. Rocks may be embedded in the magma as it cools. Apparently, the rocks trapped inside the magma contains most of the primary rocks that originated from the interior of Earth. Hence, these are though to be the rocks in the mantle.

The transitional boundary between the mantle and the core is known as the Gutenburg discontinuity. It was named after its German discoverer, Beno Gutenburg (1889-1960). This boudnary is not fixed because of changes in heat flow. When heat in the mantle slowly dissipates, the molten core gradually soldifies and shrinks, moving this boundary deeper and deeper within Earth's core.

3. *Core.*  The core is made up of iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni). The iron in the outer core is in liquid form, which is why the iron core is known to be liquid while the inner core is solid. The iron is particularly important because it is the primary source of Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field, particularly in the outer core, extends outward to protect Earth from the solar winds by deflecting it. Without this magnetic field, the solar winds could destroy Earth's atmosphere and will destroy all living forms on Earth.

Similar to the discontinuities discovered in the other layers, there is also a transitional boundary between the inner and the outer core - the Lehmann discontinuity which was discovered in 1929 by Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann (1888-1993) when a large earthquake occurred near New Zeland. Lehmann studied the shock waves and realized that these waves had traveled some distance into the core and then bounced off some kind of boundary. With this distinct behavior of the waves, Lehmann believed that there indeed lies a unique layer that separates the liquid inner core from the solid outer core.

## What Have I Learned So Far?

1. How different are the layers of Earth from each other? Describe their composition, thickness, and physical properties.
2. How did seismologists learn about the different layers of Earth? What instruments did they use? What observations did they make?
3. What forms of energy can be found in the geosphere? Where does it travel to?
4. Give the importance of energy traveling on the surface of Earth.

## The Hydrosphere
The **hydrosphere** is the total amount of water found on Earth. This included water in various forms -  whether in ice, vapor or liquid, found on or below the surface of Earth and in gas in the atmosphere. Water covers 70% of the entire surface of Earth, and most of it is ocean water.

Water has been associated with the existence of life. When water or traces of water are found in other planets, the possibility of life is always speculated. It is critical component of most organisms that drying up would mean dying.

### The Hydrological Cycle
Water circulates everywhere on Earth (see Figure 2.6). This is made possible with the interaction of energy and matter that prompts the transformation of water from one phase to another, allowing it to circulate and travel to different regions of Earth.

Water moves through the hydrosphere in a cycle. The sun's energy is the power that drives the water cycle. Light and heat causes water to evaporate from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other sources of surface water.

Liquid water on the surface of Earth changes from its liquid state to gaseous state or to water vapor when temperature increases. The water vapor rises in the atmosphere as gas (evaporation). When water droplets increase in number, they form clouds. As the water droplets form clouds, precipitation may occur. Depending on condensing temperature changes, water may fall from the atmosphere in the form of rain or snow. Liquid water goes back to rivers, lakes and oceans or seeps through rocks and soils to reach the water table. Water underground finds its way back into the ocean through slopes and cracks. In some regions where termperature below zero degrees Celsius, solid water is found in glaciers. Precipitation in the form of snow may recrystallize to form thick masses of ice callec glaciers which contain most of Earth's water supply. Again, when water is in the atmosphere it can go back to the ground during condesation and evaporation and start the cycle all over again. This whole process is called thee **hydrological** or **water cycle.** Because organisms depend mainly on water for survival, the hydrological cycle makes possible the availability of water in different areas of Earth for organisms to access it.

### Distribution of Water on Earth
All the water found on Earth are natural but not everything is considered safe for drinking. In fact only less than 2.5% of the world's water is considered freshwater. The waters are divided into two groups, surface water and groundwater. **Surface water,** as the name implies, are waters found on Earth's surface as opposed to **groundwater** which is found below the ground. The surface water and groundwater also differ int he type and amount of minerals contained in them.

#### Big Idea
While Earth is surrounded with 70% water, only less than 2.5% of it can be used for human needs. Hence, everyone is encouraged to conserve water because there really is not enough safe water for everyone's use

![[Pasted image 20210809023353.png]]

Fig. 2.7 The total amount of the world's freshwater that maybe be tapped for consumption is up to 2.5% only of the world's water resources.

Adapted from: http://www.lethbridge.ca/living-here/water-wastewater/Pages/Water.aspx (accessed on 11 November 2015)

Surface water may either be salt water or freshwater. Salt waters have higher salt content and are found in larger bodies of water such as oceans, seas, and bays, and gulfs. Freshwater, on the other hand, are those found in lakes, rivers, streams, springs, and falls which, because of the lower content of salt, are the best source of drinking water for all organisms. Sadly, freshwater accounts for only 2.5% of the world's water. This is precisely the reason for advocacies on water conservation. While it is evident that water is found almost everywhere on Earth, most of it is salt, and thus is not readily fit for drinking.

#### Reflect Upon
What freshwater in your area is not polluted? As a students and a citizen of your community, what do you think is your role in keeping nearby bodies of water in your area clean or less polluted.

Fig. 2.8 Groundwater is in the zone of saturation

Groundwater, on the other hand, is the water found beneath Earth's surface in the zone of saturation (where every pore space between rock and soil particles is saturated with water). This area underground is called an aquifer, a layer of rocks that carry or hold water. Because the water is found beneath soil layers, they may contain large amounts of minerals such as magnesium and calcium.

#### What Have I Learned So Far?
Show a flow diagram of energy transfer in water involving three processes involved in the water cycle.

#### Big Idea 
Each layer of the atmosphere has a specific protective function or importance in making the surface of Earth habitable for organisms. It is important then to improve our air quality by minimizing the mission of air pollutants and to avoid the destruction of the layers of the atmosphere.

1. *Troposphere.* The troposphere is considered to be the densest among the layers of the atmosphere because of the weight of all the other layers compressing it. Because temperature drops with altitude, warm air on the surface of Earth rises readily. Air molecules travel up and back down causing the formation of clouds and eventually rain from the moisture in the air. The vertical movement of air molecules also form air pockets that cause turbulence in this layer. Most types of clouds are in the troposhere which can be as high as 12 miles or 65 000 feet near the equator and 4 miles or 20 000 feet over the poles in winter. At the bottom of this layer is at Earth's surface. Almost all weather variations occur within the troposphere. Most jets and planes would fly slightly above the troposphere to avoid this turbulence in weather.

	Prior to reaching the next layer above the troposphere is a thin buffer zone called *tropopause.* It differs from the troposphere in that it is relatively characterized by a constant temperature.

2. *Stratosphere.* The air in this layer has strong, steady horizontal winds which are advantageous to long-distance flights. At its upper region is the *ozone layer* at about 6.2 miles or about 33 000 feet above Earth's surface which contains a high concentration of ozone. There are different types of radiation that enters Earth's atmosphere. One type, the UV-B has been known to be hazardous as it penetrates directly through the protective layers of organisms, damaging their DNA molecules and thus may cause cancer. Without the ozone layer, most of the life-forms on Earth would have perished. In the past decades, the ozone layer has been observed to be thinning. With further studies, it was determined that certain sprays and chemicals used in modern applications use ozone-depleting substances (ODS) that directly destroy the ozone molecules in the ozone layer. Most kinds of ODS contain chlorine. When these reach the stratosphere, contact with the ultraviolet radiation causes the release of chlorine which reacts with the ozone molecules. It is speculated that one chlorine atom can actually destroy 100 000 ozone molecules. Unlike other air pollutants, ODS are invisible and odorless and hence were not immediately recognized to be depleting the ozone layer. Now that these have been identified ODS are banned all over the world. Examples of ODS are some hair sprays, insulating forms, refrigerants and solvents.

	Above the stratosphere is another thin buffer zone called *stratopause.* This zone separates the stratosphere from the mesosphere.

![[Pasted image 20210809023246.png]]

Fig. 2.11 The ozone layer serves as a shield against the sun's UV radiation. UV-B radiation, which is known to cause skin cancer, can be partially filtered by the ozone layer.

3. *Mesosphere.* The mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere. The temperature here reaches a minimum of -90 Celsius degrees and is considered to be the coldest layer. The mesosphere layer may be the coldest because the heat from the sun is decreased as absorbed by the thermopshere which is directly above it and because of the absence of radiation-absorbing gases. Additionally, radiative emission of teh carbon dioxide in this layer allows for the absorption of solar heat and emits the heat back to space. The mesosphere is important in protecting Earth from planetary debris. This is where most of the space rocks, like meteors, get burned up or break down into smaller pieces. 

	The thin buffer zone above the mesosphere is called *mesopause.* This zone is actually the coldest region in the Earth.

4. *Thermosphere.* The thermosphere layer is the hottest because it absorbs highly energetic heat from the sun. Depending on the solar activity, the temperature in this layer can rise higher and reach 1000 Celsius degrees. This extreme heat causes the atmospheric particles to become electrically charged making possible radio waves to bounce off and be received beyond the horizon.

![[Pasted image 20210809023056.png]]

Fig. 2.12 Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere) protects Earth from most of the continuously streaming solar wind. Solar wind ions stream by Earth and most are repelled by the magnetosphere and some are able to enter the ionosphere where auroras happen.

Adapted from: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6950/fig_tab/424734a_F2.html (accessed on 24 November 2015)

The lower part of the thermosphere is the *ionosphere* where most collision of oxygen and nitrogen particles are electrically charged by the solar wind. The solar wind is a stream of energized, charged particles flowing from the sun. The charged particles called ions, consist of electrons and protons with high kinetic energy and the high temperature of the corona. The ions which stream continuously from the sun's surface are called solar winds. As the solar winds gets blocked by Earth's magnetic field, some of the ions are able to reach the ionosphere. In the ionosphere, the solar wind ions collide with Earth's oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The energy released during the collisions causes a powerful glow around the poles, called auroras. Auroras occur at about 60-620 miles above Earth's surface. The rate of intensity of aurora depends on the strength of the solar wind. Hence, during an intense solar storm, more visible colorful lights can be seen in the sky. The type of collision of electrically charged particles lso affects the colors that appear. For examples, collision with oxygen produces yellow and green colors, while collision with nitrogen produces red, violet and blue colors. The aurora may be visible in high altitudes of Earth. If witnessed in the northern regions like the Arctic and Northern Canada, it is called "aurora borealis" or "Northern Lights." If seen in the southern regions like the Antarctica and Southern Australia, it is called "aurora australis."

There exists a thermopause above the thermosphere which also serves a buffer effect along the exosphere and which separates Earth's atmosphere from space. The exosphere is not considered as another layer but it separates Earth's atmosphere from interplanetary space.

## What Have I Learned So Far?
Recall the previous subsystems of Earth. Identify characteristics of each subsystem that supports life. (Ex. Geosphere: it has a solid crust where organisms can live on)

## The Biosphere
The biosphere is a closed system that makes up all the living components of Earth. In this system an organism can consume another organism to allow energy to circulate to the ecosystem (see Figure 2.15). Life exists in all the subsystems of Earth - on land (geosphere), in water (hydrosphere), and in air (atmosphere)
