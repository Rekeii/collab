## Formation of the Universe

The science of cosmology provides several hypotheses explaining the beginning of the universe based on the present physical and chemical properties of the universe. There are numerous versions, but the most widely accepted ones are based on current scientific observations and available evidences that support the claims. Among the theories that have been thoroughly investigated and have gained the most support include the big bang theory, the cosmic inflation theory, and the steady state theory.

### Big Bang Theory

The Big Bang theory remains to be the top prevailing cosmological model for the early development of the universe. It provides the best explanation and is implicitly accepted. There have been many improvements and developments in the big bang theory with the continuing advancements in space instruments. In the recent past, astronomers have based their new findings on the beginnings of the universe through cosmic microwave background (CMB). It is a thermal radiation used in observational cosmology because it is considered the oldest light in the universe. CMB can be detected as glow which is believed to be a remnant from an early stage of the development of the universe. Because of this belief, the big bang theory gained the most support from the scientific community among the various theories on the origin of the universe.

Some scientists speculate through the CMB evidence that when the universe was young, before the stars and planets even existed, the universe was denser and hotter (at around 5.5 billion degrees Celsius) and filled with a uniform glow from a white fog of hydrogen plasma. The universe also contained basic particles of neutrons, electrons, and protons. Then the space expanded and cooled because of the expansion. When the universe got cooler, the neutron, electron, and proton particles decayed or combined. Over time, those particles created neutral atoms which allowed light to shine through. The light is the CMB, also referred to as "afterglow" of the big bang. This is now the reference point for studying previous and later events in the formation of the universe. The CMB was believed to have been released 380 000 years after the big bang. The clumping of particles, later on, formed the stars and galaxies that we have now. The CMB is also used to study the composition and age of the universe. Recent measurement of the age of the universe shows that it is actually older at 13.82 billion years, rather than 13.7 billion years as previously thought.

### Cosmic Inflation Theory

The most recent cosmic inflation theory is proposed by physicists Alan Guth (1947-) and Andrei Linde (1948-) in the 1980s. According to the cosmic inflation theory Guth and Linde, the early universe went under rapid expansion in space-time. The theory states that the early universe was a rapidly expanding bubble of pure vacuum energy. It did not have any matter or radiation. After the expansion and cooling due to the inflation, the potential energy was converted into kinetic energy of matter and radiation. Then a big bang occurred because of the extremely hot dense condition of the matter. Seconds after the explosion, matter began to clump together. Eventually, stars were formed, and then the galaxies (see Figure 1.3). The universe continued to expand up to present time.

The cosmic inflation theory became an accepted hypothesis because it answered many puzzles that arose in the big bang theory. One of which is the homogeneity of the objects in space. During the expansion period, objects that used to be in contact or neighboring objects got farther away from each other. Their composition, however, remained almost intact. This explains further why the opposite horizon of the universe appears to be similar. Another is the appearance of flatness or smoothness of the universe. The continuous expansion "dilutes" or gradually loses the curvature of objects. A simple way of illustrating this is to inflate a balloon with small bumps. As you inflate the balloon continuously, its surface reaches a point of flatness where the small bumps could not be recognized anymore. This similar idea accounts for the approximate flatness (lack of curvature) look in the space-time of the universe. Last is the formation of stars and star systems in later years. The theory asserts that during the expansion, small density fluctuations happen. This causes gravity to attract gas into masses, giving birth to stars and eventually galaxies. This also explains why the universe would always look full of planetary objects instead of completely empty.


### Steady State Theory

The steady state theory states that the universe is always expanding. It also states that new matter is constantly formed as the universe continues to expand. The older bodies eventually became out of sight as a consequence of their increasing distance and rate of recession. This theory further claims that the universe has no beginning or end in time, and even through it is expanding, its appearance remains the same over time.

> [[Source: http://cosmictimes.gsfc.nasa.gov/online_edition1955Cosmic/origin.html(accessed on 10 November 2015)::rsn]]Fig 1.4 The Steady State Theory says that although the universe is expanding, its appearance does not change.


This theory was first proposed by Sir James Jeans in 1920. It gained popularity after it was revised by Sir Fred Hoyle, Sir Hermann Bondi, and Thomas Gold in 1948 as an alternative to the big bang theory. However, toward the middle of 1960s, evidences would contradict the steadiness or the unchanging state of the universe were brought out. One of these evidences was when galactic bodies such as quasars and radio galaxies were found a long way from the sun at far distances in space (and found none nearby); it disproved the idea that similar bodies are created and found everywhere. Hence, distant objects in space are considered ancient and the younger universes are found nearer. This implies that the universe is actually dynamic (and not steady). In cosmology, the steady state theory is now considered obsolete.

## Formation of the Solar System

A star system, also called stellar system, is a small number of stars that orbit each other. Just like the origin of the universe there are many theories on how the star systems formed. It should be noted that Earth belongs to the [[Big Idea! The solar system is a type of star system because the sun is a star.::lsn]] *solar system*. Various theories strive to explain the chemical and physical differences of the planets and the regularity of orbital motions and directions.

## Theories that Explain the Origin of Star Systems

> [[Source: https://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/N/nebhypoth.html (accessed on 10 November 2015)::rsn]]Fig 1.6 The formation of a stellar system arose from a progressive condensation of a gaseous nebula encircling the sun. As the nebula spun rapidly, it cast off rings of gas that formed the planets later on.

### Nebular hypothesis

The nebular hypothesis seems to be the most accepted theory based on the consistency of its premises to current observations. It was developed by Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) in the 18th century (see Figure 1.6). It presupposes that around 4.5 billion years ago, a star system was formed from a rotating cloud of gas - or nebula - of extremely hot gas. When the gas cooled, the nebula began to shrink, and as it became smaller, it rotated faster, casting off rings of gas and forming a disk-like shape. This centrifugal force from the nebula's rotation and the gravitational force from the mass of the nebula formed the rings of gas outside. As the nebula continued to shrink, these rings condensed into various densities of planets and their satellites. The remaining part of the nebula, which has the most mass, formed the sun.

### Planetesimal theory

The planetesimal theory describes the formation of the planets as asserted in the nebular hypothesis. Proposed by Viktor S. Safronov (1917-1999) in 1941 and developed by T.C. Chamberlin (1843-1928) and F.R. Moulton (1872-1952), the theory states that in the early period of the solar system, planets were formed from the accretion of small space bodies. The gravity of the space bodies attracted space objects until the effect of their gravity was reduced due to the accretion which also increased the size of the planetesimals.

### Tidal Theory

The tidal theory was developed by James Jeans (1877-1946) and Sir Harold Jeffreys (1891-1989) in 1917. According to the theory, a star passed close to the sun where the tidal force or the secondary effect of gravitational pull between the passing star and the sun drew large amounts of matter out of the sun and the passing star. Some of the drawn out matter quickly cooled to become solid bodies called planetesimals. Others grew in size because of colliding and sticking together with passing objects in space, eventually forming larger clumps and gathering more and more matter. This theory is also backed up by old meteorites found on Earth, chemically dated back to about 4.5 billion years, the time approximated to be the formation of the solar system.

Many unidentified forces influenced the present conditions of these planets. At present, there are four smaller inner planets (i.e., Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) that are known to be much smaller compared with the other four outer bigger planets (i.e., Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune). Even the physical and chemical properties of these two groups differ significantly.

The four outer planets are called "gas planets" because they are made up of just primary materials that make up the sun, which are helium and hydrogen. Since they are made up of gas, it is quite impossible to walk on them. These giant gas planets are believed to have remained gaseous in nature because of their far distance from the sun. The lower temperature, known to be beyond the "frost line," allowed for the condensation of gas, forming a less dense huge planet.

On the other hand, the four inner planets are called "terrestrial" or "telluric" planets. They have developed other materials such as silicate rocks that now make up their internal structure.

Earth is one of the inner planets and as such, it would have the same parent materials as the other "terrestrial" planets.
