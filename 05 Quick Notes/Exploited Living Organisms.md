# [[Exploited Living Organisms]]
2021-08-25 14:37

## Introduction:
When we think of exploited natural resources, what comes to your mind? I bet it's minerals, our crops, the usual. I'm sure it would never be, "Exploited Living Organisms" (FLASH TITLE SCREEN), huh?

### Proof: Why Living Organisms are Natural Resources
A bit odd, isn't it? Though according to the student dictionary of Merriam-Webster, [**Natural Resources**](http://wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?natural+resource) can be defined as: "something (as a mineral, waterpower source, forest, or kind of animal) that is found in nature and is valuable to humans (as in providing a source of energy, recreation, or scenic beauty"

Keyword, "or kind of animal." Furthermore, according to [**United Nations Framework Classification for Resources** (UNFC)](https://unece.org/sustainable-energyunfc-and-sustainable-resource-management/about-unfc), is a sort of standardization, an "international scheme for the classification, management and reporting of energy, mineral, and raw material resources. Sort of like [Unicode](https://home.unicode.org/), a standardization, an international scheme.

It so happens that the UNFC has classified natural resources into 2 categories, by origin, Biotic and Abiotic. Biotic resources are resources that are apart of the biosphere, this of course means that animals or living organisms are included.

## Objectives:
- Prove and show the exploitation of living organisms in the following regions: Palawan, and Philippine Ocean.
- Bring awareness to the exploitation of living organisms in regions: Palawan, and Philippine Ocean.

## Summary:

### Palawan:
The Philippines is rich in natural resources and Palawan is home to many different species unique to our country. One such species is the *Siebenrockiella leytensis* or the Philippine Forest Turtle, classified by the **[International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)** as **Critically Endangered.**

Another classified as **Endangered** by the IUCN is the *Cyclemys dentata* or the Asian Leaf Turtle. Three more species originating from Palawan that are classified **vulnerable** are, *Manis culionensis*, Palawan Pangolin, *Tanygnathus lucionensis*, Blue-naped Parrot, *Gracula religiosa palawanensis*, Palawan hill Mynah.

### Philippine Ocean:
Another area where exploited living organisms lie are the Philippine Ocean. The *Eretmochelys imbricata* or Hawksbill Turtle is an example of this. Classified as **Critically Endangered.** by the IUCN.

### How are they exploited?
As natural resources do, they bring profit, they bring materials to the person exploiting them. The aforementioned species above are on the list of one of the most trades species in the Philippines! Turtles' shells are being sold as ornaments and jewelry. The Palawan Pangolin are popular due to their meat and scales. The Blue-naped Parrot and Palawan hill Mynah due to his "pet-able" nature when they shouldn't be traded as pets in the first place.

## Closing:
As quick as we are to think of minerals, lands, and our forests being exploited, we should not neglect the animals around us. For the Philippines is rich in not only natural resources like minerals and the sort, but we are also rich in species native only to the Philippines. We should take care of the ones still around us and preserve them lest we lose them.

**Thank you.**
